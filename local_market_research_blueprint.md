# The Local Market Research Blueprint  
## How to Find Underserved Niches Using AI + Maps

*For founders and agencies ready to spot boring but profitable opportunities first*

---

## 🎯 The Goal

This blueprint helps you:  
- Identify **underserved local niches** with high order values  
- Validate opportunities with **real-world signals** (reviews, density, hours)  
- Turn data into **leads, newsletters, or full-service sites**  
- Run it for **$20/month infra + scrape cost**, not $20,000 agency fees  

**Your commitment:** Run the flow monthly, capture insights, execute on them.

## 📊 The Reality Check

### Local Businesses Right Now:  
- 3-star reviews they never respond to  
- “Call for pricing” on every page  
- No schema, no speed optimization, no mobile fixes  
- Phone numbers hidden, broken contact forms  
- Providers closing at 5PM sharp — no emergency coverage  

### You After Running This Blueprint:  
- Data-driven map of niches + gaps  
- Clear signals: review velocity, density, hours gaps, customer pain points  
- Opportunity briefs that highlight *where you can win fast*  
- A repeatable **content + SEO launch playbook**  

---

## 🚀 PHASE 1: BUILD THE ENGINE  
*From blank canvas to automated market scanner*  

### Step 1: Set Up Accounts  
- **n8n** self-hosted (Hostinger VPS $5–$7/mo)  
- **Apify** for Google Maps scraping (~$6–$7/run)  
- **Google Sheets** for outputs  
- **Claude/LLM** for compact analysis  

### Step 2: Assemble the Flow (Node by Node)  
- Trigger → Fetch dataset → Clean & flatten → Push to Sheets  
- Compute metrics: review velocity, density, ratings variance, common tags, hours gaps  
- Collapse arrays → Feed into AI agents  
- Agents output: niches, opportunities, business study, newsletter ideas  

---

## 🔍 PHASE 2: GATHER INTELLIGENCE  
*Know your city + niche inside out*  

### Metrics to Track  
- **Review Velocity**: Who’s growing fast in last 100 days?  
- **Provider Density**: Too many players or underserved?  
- **Ratings + Variance**: Who’s loved, who’s hated, what’s missing?  
- **Common Tags**: Customers complaining about price, delays, cleanup?  
- **Hours Gaps**: No one covers nights/weekends? Emergency play unlocked.  

### AI Outputs  
- **Niche Identifier**: Common + missing niches, unique angles  
- **Opportunity Brief**: Personas, ticket sizes, arbitrage models  
- **Business Study**: Leaders vs laggards, week-1 quick wins  
- **Newsletter Ideas**: Pain-point driven topics with local hooks  

---

## 💪 PHASE 3: TURN DATA INTO ASSETS  
*Package insights into something that makes money*  

- Build a **local SEO site** targeting identified niches  
- Spin up a **newsletter or directory** → monetize with sponsorships/leads  
- Package briefs as **agency offers** to local providers  
- Use AI to draft service pages, location pages, CTAs directly from metrics  

---

## 📈 PHASE 4: GROW & REPEAT  
*Dominate more niches, more cities*  

- Rerun the flow monthly with new datasetId + city  
- Expand into **tier-2/3 cities** where competition is light  
- Layer on **content + backlinks** for the winners  
- Build a portfolio of micro-sites, newsletters, or client retainers
